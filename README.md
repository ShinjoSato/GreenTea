# Build new computer language

## Introduction
Now, in 11th December 2019, I would like to build new computer language.

## Structure
### File Name
I would like to create an language, which name is ```GreenTea```.

This file relates to Java, and the image of Java is a coffee, so I name this language as ```GreenTea```.

### Structure

This language uses Java Virtual Machine (JVM) because JVM can be used in Windows, Mac and Linux.

This project takes a long way because, you know, there are a lot of things about which I should consider, so I build it step by step.

## My image
### Icon
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/image_greentea.jpg" width=50%>
</div>

The above image is from <a href="https://publicdomainq.net/teapot-green-tea-0000548/">here</a>.

In my idea, the left side of the image suits.

### Contents
1. First proportion
    ```
    main(){
        A = 10;
        print(A);
    }
    ```
    This program looks like C.

    1. Function
   
       This main function is the type of void.
       
       Whether the type of return is int, doiuble, void and so on and so forth, we don't need to write it before the function name. we can create functions, which have same name but different argument.

    2. Variable
   
       It is not necessary to write the type of variable if the type is int, double and String because these types are identified by the element.

       (I want to create ```void``` variable, which can include ```print```, function and so on.)

### Compile
```
greentea FILENAME.gtea
```
### Execution
```
green FILENAME
```
